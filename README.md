Static personal website hosted on GitHub

What started out as just being a new personal website hosted on GitHub, has now turned into a micro-framework of sorts, or more like a basic blogging or article type website thingy.  Anyways, you can see a demo of it all working from the website which is live, right this very moment.

If you like what you see and would like to try running a similar website of your own, the easiest way is through [Puter](https://puter.com/app/puterblogger).

There is additional information on my [blog](https://kveroneau.github.io/#/AboutSite).
