Static personal website hosted on GitHub

What started out as just being a new personal website hosted on GitHub, has now turned into a micro-framework of sorts, or more like a basic blogging or article type website thingy.  Anyways, you can see a demo of it all working from the website which is live, right this very moment.

If you like what you see and would like to try running a similar website of your own, here's how all the magic works:

  * Obtain a copy of the FreePascal Compiler *for your platform of choice*.
  * Obtain a working copy of the pas2js Compiler *for your platform of choice*.
  * Take out the ducktape from your drawer and smash it all together until you have it all working.
  * Run `make dist` in the `src` directory to generate a *perfectly* working distribution in `dist/`
  * You know?  It's probably just best that you avoid this project all together and just pretend like you never saw it...

However, if you do actually care to learn more about how this all works, then check out the article on the website which <a href="https://kveroneau.github.io/#/AboutSite">describes itself</a>.
